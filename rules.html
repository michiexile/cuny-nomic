              entirely void. For the purposes of this rule a proposal to

              rule-changes compounded or is an amendment that makes no
              difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the
              other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal
              before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for this
              debate. The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal
              is to be voted on and, unless the Judge has been asked to do so,
              also decides the time to end debate and vote.

              Rule-changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply

              This game of nomic is played in a hybrid mode, as part of a course

              If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two

              with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.
            </p>

            <p>
              If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself
              that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes
              precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such
              provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
              precedence.

            <p>
              If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or
              to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.

              If players disagree about the legality of a move or the
              interpretation or application of a rule, then the professor of the
              course is to be the Judge and decide the question. If the
              professor is unable or unwilling, the TA shall be the Judge.
              Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be created by the
              insistence of any player. This process is called invoking
              Judgment.
            </p>

            <p>
              When Judgment has been invoked, the next player may not begin his
              or her turn without the consent of a majority of the other
              players.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Judge’s Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of
              the other players taken before the next turn is begun. If a
              Judge’s Judgment is overruled, then a new Judge is selected in the
              order TA, player preceding the one moving, remaining players in
              reverse order of the order of play, except that no player is to be
              Judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a
              team-mate.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions
              arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including
              questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as
              Judge.
            </p>

            <p>
              New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New
              Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the
              players currently disagree and that affect the completion of the
              turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall
              be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the
              rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue,
              then the Judge shall consider Roberts Rules of Order, game-custom,
              and the spirit of the game before applying other standards.

              played receives 10 points towards the nomic leaderboard. Players
              can also wager the points accumulated in the game of Nomic at the
              beginning of a game of Fluxx. These points are deducted from their
              total. If they win they receive back double the points they had
              wagered.

              During the consideration of a rule change, a player can propose a
              point inversion which causes the points earned to be lost and vice
              versa only for the rule change on the floor. For the inversion to
              come into effect, it must be voted on and only requires a
              majority.

              Pull requests will be handled as a priority queue. Each player may
              set priority of a pull request by proposing to spend positive
              point balances. A player with zero or negative points may not set
              priority on pull requests. Equal priority pull requests are
              handled in pull request number order. Point amounts are filed with
              the chair at the beginning of each meeting and may be revised
              once, and are deducted once the pull request is open for
              discussion.

              A <strong>dissenter</strong> is someone who votes against a

            <p>
              If and when rule-changes can be adopted without unanimity, the
              dissenter shall receive 10 points. If there are two dissenters,
              they receive 5 points each. If 3 or more dissenters exist, they
              receive no points.

              adoption of the rule-change, the player who proposed the rule
              change will lose 10 points, plus 10 points for each voting nay by

              Each pull request relating to rule changes must correspond to a
              single rule change. Pull requests that do not follow this rule
              must be amended before consideration and the proposer receives a
              20 point penalty.
            </p>

            <p>
              Players may not manipulate pull request numbers to increase the
              point value of future pull requests. Players who manipulate pull
              request numbers receive a 20 point penalty. Manipulation is
              defined as someone submitting the same pull request repeatedly or
              submits and withdraws before consideration.
            </p>

            <p>
              Any pull requests that do not have correct file names or markdown
              format will result in a 20 point penalty for the proposer.

              If a player is going to receive a point deduction, they have the
              right to propose this motion to telling a joke in front of the
              assembly. This motion is not debateable. After the player finishes
              telling the joke, other players will vote on whether the joke is
              funny or not. Players who find the joke funny say “haha~”, while
              those who don’t find it funny say “E~”.
            </p>

            <p>
              A majority vote of “haha~” is required to determine if the joke is
              funny. If the joke is determined to be funny, the point deduction
              on the player will be void. If the joke is determined not to be
              funny, the point deduction remains.
            </p>

            <p>
              If the proposer of this rule sees someone laughing but voting
              “E~”, they can point out that the specific player’s vote is not
              truthful. The chair, presumably a designated authority, will
              determine if the player’s vote is truthful. If the chair
              determines the vote is truthful, the player’s vote remains the
              same. If the chair determines the vote is untruthful, the player’s
              vote will be reversed from “E~” to “haha~”.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once a player votes “E~” and the result of the vote is recorded,
              they cannot change their vote, even if they later realize the joke
              is funny.

              Players late to class by more than 15 minutes receive a base point
              penalty equal to the number of minutes they are late minus 15 to a
              maximum base penalty of 45 points. Players absent from class will
              receive a 50 point base penalty. Penalty can be waived if valid
              excuse is provided to the professor before hand.
            </p>

            <p>
              Base penalties are multiplied by the number of members already in
              the class at the time of the late student’s arrival. In the event
              of absence the base penalty will be multiplied by the number of
              members in class at the time of Nomic adjournment of that day.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the purposes of this rule, gameplay points are considered
              separately from penalties for lateness or absence or other
              reasons.
            </p>

            <p>
              If a player loses enough gameplay points during the game of Nomic
              to end up with a negative gameplay point balance at the end of
              class, that gameplay point balance will be multiplied by -1,
              giving the player a positive gameplay point balance instead of a
              negative gameplay point balance. For example, if a player is left
              with -40 gameplay points at the end of the class meeting, that
              gameplay point balance is converted to 40 gameplay points.
            </p>

            <p>
              If the rule passes, all players, except for the player proposing
              this rule, receives 15 gameplay points. All points on the
              scoreboard when this rule passes are considered gameplay points.
