Players may jointly endorse submitted rule changes as co-sponsors, and have the pull request be considered under all of their names.
If a jointly endorsed rule change is approved, all co-sponsors shall separately decide whether to share or steal the points, with no communication between each other from the moment of the rule change's approval to the moment of revealing their choices, by writing "share" or "steal" on index cards.
Co-sponsors who violate this no communication rule shall have their scores reset to 0 points and shall be disqualified from choosing to share or steal for the approved rule change.
In the event that only one co-sponsor is not disqualified, then they shall receive twice the base points for the proposal.
Otherwise:
If all co-sponsors who have not been disqualified choose to share the points, then they shall all receive the full base points for the proposal.
If only one co-sponsor who has not been disqualified chooses to steal, then they shall receive twice the base points for the proposal.
If two or more co-sponsors who have not been disqualified choose to steal, then all co-sponsors shall lose 10 points.
