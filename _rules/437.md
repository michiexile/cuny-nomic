Players may jointly endorse submitted rule changes as co-sponsors, and have the pull request be considered under all of their names.
If a jointly endorsed pull request is adopted, all co-sponsors shall separately decide whether to share or steal the points, with no communication between each other from the moment of the proposal's adoption to the moment of revealing their choices, by writing "share" or "steal" on index cards.
Co-sponsors who violate this no communication rule shall have their scores reset to 0 points.
If all co-sponsors choose to share the points, then they shall all receive the full base points for the proposal.
If only one co-sponsor chooses to steal, then they shall receive twice the base points for the proposal.
If two or more co-sponsors choose to steal, then all co-sponsors shall lose 10 points.
