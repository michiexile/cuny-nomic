When a tie occurs during a vote, the proposer has the option to play a game of rock paper scissor with each of the members who voted nay, individually.
If the proposer wins this game against a majority of individuals who voted nay, then the the vote passes. If the proposer fails to win against the majority he suffers an extra 10 point penalty on top of any penalty imposed by the failed motion.
