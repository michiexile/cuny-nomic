Pull requests will be handled as a priority queue. 
Each player may set priority of a pull request by proposing to spend positive point balances. 
A player with zero or negative points may not set priority on pull requests. 
Equal priority pull requests are handled in pull request number order.
Point amounts are filed with the chair at the beginning of each meeting and may be revised once, and are deducted once the pull request is open for discussion.
