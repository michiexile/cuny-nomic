If a rule change passes with an amendment, each adopted amendment to the rule change will award points to the player who introduced said amendment. The number of points that will be awarded, per adopted amendment, will be equal to the base points of the rule change before it is multiplied by the proportion of favorable votes, rounded up to the nearest integer.
