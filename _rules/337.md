If a game of Fluxx is played in the class, the winner of each game played receives 10 points towards the nomic leaderboard. Players can also wager the points accumulated in the game of Nomic at the beginning of a game of Fluxx. These points are deducted from their total. If they win they receive back double the points they had wagered.
