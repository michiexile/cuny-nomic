In moments of crisis, to protect the rights of the assembly, the chair may issue a vote to assume total executive authority for the remainder of the nomic session.
All further motions that require a vote may then be decided by the chair directly, and are not subject to repeal.
At any point during the session, once the crisis has been handled, the chair may abdicate such authority. 
To assume total executive authority, unanimous consent from all present members is required. Each time this motion fails, the chair's points shall be halved, rounded down to the nearest integer.
