When a point of order of is raised against another member and well-taken, the raiser gains 3 points and the member it was raised against loses 3 points. If the point of order is not well-taken, the raiser loses 3 points, and the raised against member gains 3 points. If the raised against member successfully appeals this decision, all resulting point losses/gains from the point of order exchange are erased.
