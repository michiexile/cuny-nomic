The players must decide on the minimum number of eligible players that are required to be present at a meeting for voting to take place. If fewer than this minimum number of eligible players are present at a meeting, no voting on rules shall take place until the minimum number is reached. A new rule listing this chosen minimum number should be created and voted on by at least 2/3 of all eligible players.
