Rule proposing is going to be done in alphabetical order based on the initial of a player's name. 
Each player takes their turn to propose a rule change when it is their turn.

One player can submit multiple rule changes at once on GitHub, but they are limited to a maximum of three rule changes at once. 
After submitting three consecutive rule changes, the next rule change proposal must come from the next player in the alphabetical order.

If there are multiple pull requests on GitHub, the pull requests from the players in order will be prioritized, and so on.

Players must propose at least one rule change when the previous player in the alphabetical order has finished their turn to propose a rule change. 
Failure to do so results in that player receiving a 50 point deduction.

Players must prepare the rule change proposals for the group's discussion while it's their turn to propose a rule change. 
In case of we going to pass multiple turns in one class.
