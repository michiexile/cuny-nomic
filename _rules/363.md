If a player is going to receive a point deduction, they have the right to propose this motion to telling a joke in front of the assembly. This motion is not debateable.
After the player finishes telling the joke, other players will vote on whether the joke is funny or not.
Players who find the joke funny say "haha~", while those who don't find it funny say "E~".

A majority vote of "haha~" is required to determine if the joke is funny.
If the joke is determined to be funny, the point deduction on the player will be void.
If the joke is determined not to be funny, the point deduction remains.

If the proposer of this rule sees someone laughing but voting "E~", they can point out that the specific player's vote is not truthful.
The chair, presumably a designated authority, will determine if the player's vote is truthful.
If the chair determines the vote is truthful, the player's vote remains the same.
If the chair determines the vote is untruthful, the player's vote will be reversed from "E~" to "haha~".

Once a player votes "E~" and the result of the vote is recorded, they cannot change their vote, even if they later realize the joke is funny.
