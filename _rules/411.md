The Chair and Secretary have suffered enough: it’s time they get paid in points!
The Chair shall graciously collect 25% of all points from each game session, because leadership has its perks.
The Secretary earns 50% of all points, mainly for dealing with everyone’s nonsense and keeping score without losing their mind.
Any negative points will be magically turned positive because we don't need bad vibes. 
This glorious new rule takes effect immediately and forever.
