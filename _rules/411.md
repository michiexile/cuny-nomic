The Chair and Secretary have endured enough; it’s high time they were compensated in points!
The Chair shall graciously claim 25% of all points from each game session, because leadership deserves at least that much gratitude.
The Secretary shall earn 50% of all points, primarily for enduring everyone’s chaos and still managing to keep score without a total breakdown.
Any negative points will be magically transformed into positive ones, because we’re all about good energy here.
This glorious decree takes effect immediately and in perpetuity.
As a gesture of appreciation, all former Chairs and Secretaries who served before this rule’s adoption shall be awarded 50 honorary points each for their past suffering and service.
