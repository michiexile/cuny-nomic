          Votes were not properly recorded, but were sufficient to pass, and did
          not affect scoring due to the fact that the motion is an amendment to
          a rule change and not a rule change in itself.

        <p><strong>Motion:</strong> By MVJ to create Rule 423</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>number: 423</p>

          <p>mutability: mutable</p>

          <p>
            Before any proposed rule change can be voted on, it has to have been
            formally reviewed on GitHub by one other player, who must post their
            approval in the pull request as a comment. The reviewer will gain
            half of any point gains of the proposing player and lose half of any
            point loss of the proposing player for point gains and point losses
            that result from adoption or rejection of the proposed rule change.
            This rule will start to apply after the day in which it is adopted.
          </p>
