# CUNY-Nomic

This is the repository used for a Nomic game, played as part of a course at the CUNY Graduate Center, and mediated through GitHub pull requests paired with in-person sessions following Robert's Rules of Order to decide on whether or not to accept any one pull request.

This `main` branch serves as a seed state, from which can be branched whenever a new semester and a new course starts, and thus the Nomic game itself starts over with a new player base.
